  <h1>Creating a Github page using Go Templates and Github Actions</h1>

  <p>
    After 12 or so years, I decided to start working on a personal site again. I
    was inspired by the the AI ghibli animation pictures that are suddenly so
    trendy. I took design inspiration from other low key personal pages i've
    seen on Hacker News.
  </p>
  <p>
    Getting reacquainted with github pages, I quickly found myself wanting for a
    bit more power than static HTML could provide. The default option provided
    is Jekyll. While i'm sure it works fine, a ball of Ruby written by the
    former CEO of Github over a decade ago seems like a toolchain I don't want
    to come to grips with. Hugo could also work, but it seemed like overkill. I
    just wanted dead simple templates and a couple of them. Making a Next.js
    site also seemed like a drag. An empty next.js project is 30mb. Seems
    bloated for what I'm trying to accomplish.
  </p>
  <p>
    After a bit of research, I got the idea to write my own static site
    generator in Go. Go templates are pretty simple and relatively primative but
    could get the job done for a static page like a blog. While powerful, they
    lack the creature comforts of what one would expect with tooling like React.
  </p>
  <p>
    They say good artists copy, and great artists steal. I wonder if it applies
    to coders. While kinda cliche, I was able to borrow inspiration from some
    other prevalent web technologies. I like the next.js pages routing. It
    harkens back to the good old days of web. Simple and easy to grok. The
    assets folder that rails has is also simple enough to understand. I can rock
    with that.
  </p>
  <p>
    At first I just wanted a blog, but eventually I wanted it to work in a
    gitOps sort of way. I leveraged github actions to SSG the static pages at
    build time, then load the bundle up. Lucky for me, most of these actions
    already exist, so I just had to write a touch of code to generate the static
    pages.
  </p>
  <h3>The Good</h3>
  <p>
    This has some nice side effects. Pages just work. it's great. No JS. No
    react. no context or state, just writing.
  </p>
  <p>
    The project has zero dependencies outside of the go standard library. I use
    makefiles because i'm a luddite, but not required by any means.
  </p>
  <p>
    I got pretty far with virtually no CSS. While it is probably not that
    accessible, as I write more, I can concoct the minimal amount of styles.
  </p>
  <p>
    You want draft posts? It's called a branch; merge to the <code>main</code> and it gets
    released.
  </p>
  <h3>The Bad (slash things to solve later)</h3>
  <p>
    this serves as a list of known flaws (it's a quick and dirty product) slash
    informal to-do list for myself.
  </p>
  <p>
    Local dev workflow is kinda jank. There is no "hot reload" yet (although I
    could probably whip this up pretty quickly). It currently consists of
    opening the page in the browser.
  </p>
  <p>
    I don't think i've completely solved image rewriting / correct relative
    asset paths yet. I should probably test with a proper local static file
    server. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Overall, this was a pretty simple project and didn't take me long to do, but
    I think it's important to realize how much we sometimes over complicate
    simple things and end up using a clunky ass tool because it's "easier".
  </p>
  <p>
    It would be nice to embed some metadata in each page template with things
    like title, article name, updated at etc to populate SEO things like meta
    descriptions and to keep it DRY.

    You can view the source code here if you're so inclined:
    <a href="https://github.com/enahs/enahs.github.io">github</a>. It's open
    source for now because ain't no way in hell i'm paying github no damn $4/mo
    for a private repo.
