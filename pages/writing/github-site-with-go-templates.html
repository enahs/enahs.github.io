    After 12 or so years, I decided to start working on a personal site again.
    I was inspired by the ghibli animation picture and took design inspiration from other minimal pages i'd seen on Hacker News.
</p>
<p>
    Getting reacquainted with github pages, I quickly found myself wanting for a bit more power
    than static HTML could provide. The default option is Jekyll, but this is far from my favorite. 
    Ruby written by the former CEO of Github over a decade ago seems like a toolchain I don't want to install.
    Hugo could also work, but it seemed like overkill. I just wanted a few templates. simple. 
    Don't need a whole Next.js installation.
</p>
<p> So I set out to create my own static site generator in Go. The same templates that you'd use for a helm chart. To call Go templates lacking would be generous. 
    While powerful, they lack the creature comforts of what one would expect with react.</p>
