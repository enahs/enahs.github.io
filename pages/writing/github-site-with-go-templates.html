<h1>Creating a blog with github actions</h1>

<p>
    After 12 or so years, I decided to start working on a personal site again.
    I was inspired by the ghibli animation picture and took design inspiration from other minimal pages i'd seen on Hacker News.
</p>
<p>
    Getting reacquainted with github pages, I quickly found myself wanting for a bit more power
    than static HTML could provide. The default option is Jekyll, but this is far from my favorite. 
    Ruby written by the former CEO of Github over a decade ago seems like a toolchain I don't want to install.
    Hugo could also work, but it seemed like overkill. I just wanted a few templates. simple. 
    Don't need a whole Next.js installation.
</p>
<p> So I set out to create my own static site generator in Go. The same templates that you'd use for a helm chart. To call Go templates lacking would be generous. 
    While powerful, they lack the creature comforts of what one would expect with react.</p>
<p>They say good artists copy, and great artists steal. That's kinda cliche, but I was able to grab some inspiration from other web frameworks. The pages thing that next.js had was kinda nifty. I like that. I'll use it. The assets folder that rails has, I can rock with that.</p>    
<p>
    My goals with this project were pretty simple:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>leverage Github Actions to build my site bundle</li>
    <li>Be able to embed environment variables</li>
    <li>Keep it simple</li>
</ol>


<p>for the first point, I've been goofing around in infra land long enough to know my way around a pipeline or two.</p>
<p>embedding environment variables seemed like a big enough of a feature that this would require a bit of thought.</p>
<p>By using go, I knew it would be fast and compact.</p>
<p>As for further features, it'd be nice to have some HTML linting at build time.</p>
<p>Overall, this was a pretty simple project and didn't take me long to do, but I think it's important to realize how much we sometimes over complicate simple things and end up using a clunky ass tool because it's "easier".</p>
